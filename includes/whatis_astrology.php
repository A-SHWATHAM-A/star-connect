It depends on their house placement.</p>
                    <p>For example, it is not always a compulsion that Saturn will bring negative impacts or Jupiter will be a positive one.</p>
                    <p>Every house in the Kundli represents a different aspect of one&#39;s life. Similarly, Sun Signs, Moon Signs, Ascendants, and Descendants have their own significance.
